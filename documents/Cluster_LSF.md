# Load Sharing Facility (LSF) by IBM
LSF is a resource cluster management system developed by IBM. In our lab, LSF manages and distributes GPU resources. 

## What's in our cluster:
cuda10.1, cuda9.0, anaconde3, python3.6, python3.7, pytorch

## How to use the cluster:
> $ bsub < job_sub.sh
> 
## Understand the relation between "local" virtual environment and the cluster:
Users can create their own virtual environment based on this [instruction](https://github.com/ruiyangqin2016/rmyy_medical_segmentation/blob/main/documents/How_to_use_remote_server.md). (To be continue...)
